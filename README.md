The key objective of this research was to study each variable to understand 
their characteristics by analyzing the underlying patterns and time series 
components present in them and see whether the Day-ahead price of 
electricity is itself sufficient for forecasting or other variables such as Coal, 
Onshore Wind, and Day-ahead electricity impacts the forecasting values. 

The objective of this research to analyze the variables individually, finding 
any relationship between them and implementing time series models on 
them (Day-ahead Price, Day-ahead Demand, Coal and Day-ahead Onshore 
wind) have been successfully carried out. This research has carried a 
thorough analysis of the primary variables involved in predicting the 
Day-ahead price of electricity. Overall, all the variables have been individually 
examined and time series models have been implemented to check the 
performance of everyone using the RMSE evaluation metric. With the 
prospect of all variables together examined by implementing a multivariate 
model. To find whether any of the other variables are impacting the 
performance of others or not. The result was that the univariate models have 
performed better for 3 variables (Day-ahead Onshore wind energy, Hard 
Fossil Fuel (Coal), and Day-ahead Electricity price) except for Day-ahead 
Demand. There was a very weak correlation between the variables or a 
negative correlation. The performance of univariate models was much better 
when compared against multivariate ones. The forecasting was done for a 
short period of 5 days. The best models were the Holtwinters and SARIMA 
since the data has seasonality in them which are ably supported in these 
models. These findings will crucially help Irish wind energy markets and 
other energy sectors to reduce the forecast error which is a major concern in 
the Day-ahead electricity market and it also causes a huge loss for the market 
trader in the I-SEM market.
